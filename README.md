# Fully Homomorphic Encryption

*To my knowledge, this was the first public implementation of a Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme.*

## Overview

This is a simple client-server calculator which uses the Fully Homomorphic
Encryption scheme described in *Gentry (2008)*.  The scheme allows the server
to performs arbitrary arithmetic operations without ever knowing what the
values of the operands are.

If you are only looking for the `libfhe` library itself, check out the `lib`
branch of this repository.  See the wiki pages at
<https://github.com/rdancer/fhe/wiki/_pages> for more detailed information on
this project.

> Note: This project was the first publicly available implementation of the
> encryption system described in Gentry (2008).  You are more than welcome to
> fork it or contribute patches, however, please consider using e.g. the
> <https://hcrypt.com/> project instead.
>
> In particular, this demo is unfinished, and, because when it was developed,
> [*NaCl*][nacl] was a new technology, with changing API, some work may be
> required to make it work in contemporary versions of Google Chrome.

## Project Structure

This project is split between four interdependent modules:

1. The `libfhe` library, written in C
2. A *Native Client (NaCl)* plugin, written in C++; uses the `libfhe` library;
   compiles into several binary files: one per each supported architecture.
3. A directory with files to be served by a normal HTTP server such as Apache.
   Written in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. The compiled *NaCl* binaries must be
   copied here.
4. Custom XML-RPC server; uses the `libfhe` library

Each individual sub-project contains a `Makefile`, which automates most of the
work.  However, some manual copying and configuration must still be performed;
some of the required steps may not be documented.

## Normal Operation

1. A *Native-Client-capable* **web browser** (such as Google Chrome *[Note: the
   project may need to be updated to work with contemporary browsers]*)
   connects to the **web server**, the client downloads the *NaCl* binary
   appropriate for the CPU architecture it is running on.  The UI is
   initialised.
2. User enters an arithmetic formula and presses the *Calculate* button
3. **Web browser** pre-processes the formula, and sends it (encrypted) to the
   **XML-RPC server**
4. **XML-RPC server**, computes the result, and sends it (still encrypted) back
   to the **web browser**
5. **Web browser** decrypts the result, shows the result to the user, and
   updates the UI accordingly

The `libfhe` library handles the encryption, decryption, and operations on the
encrypted numbers.  The **XML-RPC server**, while being able to perform
operations on the numbers, will have no knowledge of their value.
